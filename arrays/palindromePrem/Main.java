// Problem 1.4 Palindrome Premutations 
// Given a function to check if it is a premutation of a palindrome. 
// A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same fowards and backwards. 
// A premutation is a rearrangment of letters. The palindrome does not need 
// to be limited to just dictionary words. 

// I/P: Tact Coa || O/P: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
